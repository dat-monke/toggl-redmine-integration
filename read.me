Intended Behavior: 
1. Read all entries from Toggl Detailed View file 
2. Round all entries into 0:15m || 0.25h entries
3. Combine any entries that fall under the same toggl_project in the same date 
4. Send API call to Redmine 
5. Return success or fail until all entries have been attempted
6. Display all entries attempted in a dataframe 


Steps to use application: 
1.  Update REDMINE_API_KEY
2.  Update PROJECT_MAP
2.1 Format for PROJECT_MAP is "{[toggl_project]}": {"project_id": [project_id_from_api]}
2.2 project_id_from_api is only retreivable via API call. Refer to: https://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Rest_Projects
3.  Set activity_id if different. Currently Management and Meeting is set, being 13 and 15 respectively. Refer to the API response to set other activity ids. 
3.  Download Toggl timelog entry in Detailed View 
4.  Execute the script
